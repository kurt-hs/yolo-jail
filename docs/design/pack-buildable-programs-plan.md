# Plan: buildable pack programs

**Status:** 2026-10-22. Completed against the tree at `c0a14f4e4`, by the maintainer's
authorization to build tonight on the design's leanings. The design's three open questions are
unruled, and the tasks a ruling would change say so: [OQ-BG1](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG1)
shapes Tasks 5 and 8, [OQ-BG2](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG2) Tasks 7 and 10, and
[OQ-BG3](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG3) Task 8.

**Design:** [`pack-buildable-programs.md`](pack-buildable-programs.md).

**Precedence:** the design wins on behavior. The tree wins on fact, for cosmetic drift only:
follow it and say so in the report. This plan is advice and the first thing to be wrong. **Stop
and report, do not commit**, when:

- a test does not fail the way its task predicts;
- a named file is dirty with someone else's work;
- a named symbol is gone;
- the fix needs a file outside the task's fence;
- a gate fails outside the task's scope.

Never twist code to match the plan.

**House rules this change touches**, by their enforcing command:

- `just format` before each commit;
- `just check-ci` once, at landing, on the combined tree;
- the integration tests named per task, plus the full `go test -count=1 -timeout 0 ./integration`
  at landing, because Tasks 4, 5, 7 and 8 change the launch path;
- nested-jail verification from `just build-dev-bundle` for every `cmd/`/`internal/` task
  ([AGENTS.md, Testing](../../AGENTS.md#testing)).

Never `--no-verify`; never `just install` in the jail.

## Map

| Path | Change | Task |

## Reuse before you write

- **The build act:** `buildFork` / `buildForkUnderLock` (`internal/cli/forkbuild.go:756`, `:799`).
  It already provides the lock, the hit after the lock, staging, the sealed jail, admission, the
  receipt and the settle. Add a source branch only. Never write a second build function.
- **Build identity:** `buildID(source, commit, recipe, platform)` (`forkbuild.go:337`). Pass
  `pack:<pack>/<from>` as source and the tree digest as commit.
- **The hit check:** `resolveForkBuild(store, bin, platform, source, revision, recipe)`
  (`internal/cli/capturematerialize.go:555`). The host floor calls it too (`hostfloor.go:179`).
- **The tree copy:** `copySourceTree(src, dst)` (`forkbuild.go:1398`). Add a skip for `.git`
  (advice: as a parameter, because the fork path copies a checkout that has no `.git` at its
  root anyway).
- **The digest:** `treedigest.OfSkipping(root, map[string]bool{".git": true})`
  (`internal/treedigest/treedigest.go:48`).
- **The build jail argv:** `forkBuildJailArgv(build)` (`forkbuild.go:1439`). It cds to
  `/workspace/src` and then runs the line. The placement script is the line (Task 4).
- **Seal narrowing:** a patched extension seals to its contributing pack alone (PPX-D5, in
  `forkBuildRunJail`). A pack-tree program does the same. It has no base.
- **Launch wiring:** `Options.forkPins` → `forkBuildPlan` → `BuildSlot` → `ForkDelivery`
  (`internal/cli/run/forkbuild.go:98-200`). `YOLO_FORK_BUILDS` carries the key per `bin`. Do not
  rename the variable.
- **The source launcher:** `sourceAgentLauncherSegments` (`internal/entrypoint/forklauncher.go:124`)
  and its install-only branch (`:275-283`). Readiness already calls it.
- **The download:** `packbin.Fetcher.Ensure(ctx, Want)` and `packbin.Path`
  (`internal/packbin/packbin.go:152`, `:59`). Platform-key and URL/sha256 shape checks live in
  `internal/loopholedecl/binaries.go:284-333`. Lift them into a shared helper rather than copying
  them.
- **User-scope-only pattern:** `validatePrograms` and `ProgramsAutoprune`
  (`internal/config/programs.go`) already read the user file directly and refuse a workspace
  `programs` key. `overrides` inherits both for free.
- **The scope predicate:** `paths.WorkspaceScopeBreach(path)`
  (`internal/paths/workspacescope.go:137`).
- **Context mounts:** `Options.configCtxMounts` (`internal/cli/run/ctxmounts.go:55`) is the one
  reading that feeds the argv, the briefing and the disclosure. On macos-user, context mounts
  become `ContextLink`s that the profile builder grants (`internal/macosuser/seatbelt.go:160`).
- **Integration fixtures:** `TestForkBuildDeliversTheForkInPlaceOfItsBase`
  (`integration/forkbuild_test.go:62`) for a `file://` fixture pack and a sh-only build line;
  `withReadiness()` (`integration/harness_test.go:1306`) to turn the readiness act back on;
  `integration/packbinary_test.go` for a local TLS server serving a digest-pinned file.

## Traps

- **`InstallKindSource` has 34 non-test sites across 15 files** (`rg -n InstallKindSource internal
  --type go`). A `via: "pack"` program projects to `Kind: "source"` so that it gets the source
  launcher, the materialize and readiness unchanged, but **every pin and fork-rewrite site must
  exclude it** with `Install.IsPackTree()`. The symptom of a missed site: the host floor says
  *"fork has no usable pin"* for a pack-tree program. The sites that read a pin:
  - `internal/hostfloor/floor.go` (`forkPin`, `awaitsPin`, `pinFork`, `recipeNoEntryReason`);
  - `internal/hostfloor/ensure.go`;
  - `internal/cli/hostfloor.go`;
  - `internal/cli/packupdate.go`;
  - `internal/cli/capturehost.go`.

  Audit every site and list each one with its verdict in the Task 3 report.
- **The `fallback` JSON key is taken** by `Contribution.Fallback` (a string, for an unmodified
  extension). The program's download key is `prebuilt`. An object under `fallback` fails to
  decode.
- **The integration suite turns readiness off** (`readinessEnvForSuite`). A test of step 6 that
  forgets `withReadiness()` passes vacuously: the launch starts and nothing is refused.
- **`git add` before a nested image rebuild.** nix sees tracked files only, so an untracked new
  file is silently missing from the nested jail.
- **Selection is newest-wins on a one-second receipt stamp.** The floor takes the entry the act
  returns, never a second lookup (FP-D16's reason). Keep that in `yolo pack build --force`.
- **The darwin symlink class:** resolve an override path with `filepath.EvalSymlinks` *before* the
  scope check and before the mount. On a Mac, `/tmp` is a link to `/private/tmp`. Reproduce on
  Linux with `TMPDIR=/tmp/link` ([AGENTS.md, Testing](../../AGENTS.md#testing)).
- **`from` is already a field on `Contribution`** (`contributes.go:328`, pack-relative). The
  per-kind field census (search `case "from"` near `contributes.go:4456`) must accept it on a
  program only when `via` is `"pack"`, or `{"kind":"program","via":"npm","from":"x"}` validates
  and silently does nothing.
- **The build jail's home is the capture home.** `HOME` in the placement script is
  `/home/agent`. The store records home-relative paths, and that is why building in place under
  `~/.local/lib` makes the entry relocatable.

## Tasks

### Task 1 — manifest vocabulary (independent)

- **Settled (do not re-open):** `via: "pack"` requires `from` and `run`. `build` is optional, one
  line. `prebuilt` is optional, a map from `<goos>/<goarch>` to `{url, sha256}` under `binaries`'
  rules. The delivery fields of other vias and the fork fields are refused by name. Behavior
  fields, `platforms` and `node_floor` are allowed. `prebuilt` is refused in an official pack.
- **Preconditions:** `go test ./internal/packdecl/...` is green at the start.
- **Tests first** (`internal/packdecl/packtree_test.go`):

```go
package packdecl

import (
	"strings"
	"testing"
)

func goodPackTree() Contribution {
	return Contribution{
		Kind: KindProgram, Bin: "board", Via: ViaPack,
		From: "tools/board-cli", Build: "npm ci && npm run bundle", Run: "dist/board.js",
	}
}

func TestAPackTreeProgramValidates(t *testing.T) {
	if p := validateContribution("contributes[0]", goodPackTree()); len(p) > 0 {
		t.Fatalf("refused:\n%s", strings.Join(p, "\n"))
	}
	c := goodPackTree()
	c.Build = "" // no build line: the tree runs as shipped
	c.Prebuilt = map[string]PrebuiltBuild{"linux/amd64": {
		URL: "https://example.invalid/board", SHA256: strings.Repeat("a", 64)}}
	c.Platforms, c.NodeFloor = []string{"linux"}, "22.19"
	if p := validateContribution("contributes[0]", c); len(p) > 0 {
		t.Fatalf("refused:\n%s", strings.Join(p, "\n"))
	}
}

func TestPackTreeRefusals(t *testing.T) {
	for name, tc := range map[string]struct {
		mut  func(*Contribution)
		want string
	}{
		"no from":        {func(c *Contribution) { c.From = "" }, `"from"`},
		"absolute from":  {func(c *Contribution) { c.From = "/etc" }, "relative"},
		"escaping from":  {func(c *Contribution) { c.From = "../x" }, ".."},
		"no run":         {func(c *Contribution) { c.Run = "" }, `"run"`},
		"escaping run":   {func(c *Contribution) { c.Run = "../../bin/sh" }, ".."},
		"two-line build": {func(c *Contribution) { c.Build = "a\nb" }, "one command line"},
		"fork_of":        {func(c *Contribution) { c.ForkOf = "pi" }, `"fork_of"`},
		"package":        {func(c *Contribution) { c.Package = "x" }, `"package"`},
		"produces":       {func(c *Contribution) { c.Produces = []string{".local/bin/board"} }, `"produces"`},
		"http prebuilt": {func(c *Contribution) {
			c.Prebuilt = map[string]PrebuiltBuild{"linux/amd64": {URL: "http://x", SHA256: strings.Repeat("a", 64)}}
		}, "https"},
		"bad platform": {func(c *Contribution) {
			c.Prebuilt = map[string]PrebuiltBuild{"linux": {URL: "https://x", SHA256: strings.Repeat("a", 64)}}
		}, "goos/goarch"},
		"empty prebuilt": {func(c *Contribution) { c.Prebuilt = map[string]PrebuiltBuild{} }, "at least one"},
	} {
		c := goodPackTree()
		tc.mut(&c)
		p := strings.Join(validateContribution("contributes[0]", c), "\n")
		if !strings.Contains(p, tc.want) {
			t.Errorf("%s: problems %q do not name %q", name, p, tc.want)
		}
	}
}

func TestRunAndPrebuiltOffAPackTreeAreRefused(t *testing.T) {
	c := Contribution{Kind: KindProgram, Bin: "x", Via: "npm", Package: "x", Run: "a", From: "b"}
	p := strings.Join(validateContribution("contributes[0]", c), "\n")
	for _, f := range []string{`"run"`, `"from"`} {
		if !strings.Contains(p, f) {
			t.Errorf("an npm program's %s validated: %q", f, p)
		}
	}
}
```

  Red: `go test ./internal/packdecl/ -run 'PackTree|RunAndPrebuilt'` fails to compile (`ViaPack`,
  `Run`, `Prebuilt`, `PrebuiltBuild` undefined).
- **Change:**
  - add `ViaPack = "pack"` to `knownVias`, with installKind `InstallKindSource`;
  - add `Run string \`json:"run,omitempty"\`` and `Prebuilt map[string]PrebuiltBuild
    \`json:"prebuilt,omitempty"\``, documented in the doc comment house style, which is the
    schema reference;
  - add a `packTreeProblems` arm in the program `switch` (~`contributes.go:4238`);
  - extend the placement refusal so that `run`/`prebuilt`/`from` on any other program is
    refused;
  - lift the platform, URL and sha256 checks out of `loopholedecl/binaries.go` into a helper that
    both callers use;
  - add an official-pack census beside `TestNoOfficialPackDeclaresABinary` that refuses
    `prebuilt` in any embedded `pack.json`.
- **Gates:**
  - `go test ./internal/packdecl/... ./internal/loopholedecl/... ./internal/packload/...`;
  - `TestKnownViasCoversTheShippedMechanisms`, rewritten so its literal names `pack`;
  - `just format`.
- **Fences:** nothing under `internal/cli`, `internal/entrypoint` or `internal/config`.
- **Ships with:** the `docs/reference/pack-system.md` program schema; `config_ref.txt` where it
  lists vias.
- **Commit:** `feat(packdecl): declare a program built from the pack's own tree`
- **Report:** the red compile error, the green run, and every test whose expected via list
  changed.

### Task 2 — `programs.overrides` (independent)

- **Settled:** `programs.overrides.<bin>` is `{path, run?}`, user scope only. `path` has `~`
  expanded, must be absolute after expansion, and is checked at launch (Task 8) rather than here.
  `run` is relative, cleaned, with no `..`. A workspace `programs` key is already an error. Keep
  its message, and extend the reason so it covers choosing a program's bytes too.
- **Tests first** (`internal/config/programs_test.go`): with a user config of
  `{"programs":{"overrides":{"board":{"path":"~/x"},"pi":{"path":"/srv/pi","run":"dist/cli.js"}}}}`,
  `ProgramOverrides(nil)` returns two entries, `board.Path == $HOME/x` and `pi.Run ==
  "dist/cli.js"`. These shapes must each produce a validation error naming the field:
  - `{"programs":{"overrides":{"board":{"path":""}}}}`;
  - `{"programs":{"overrides":{"board":{"path":"rel/x"}}}}`;
  - `{"programs":{"overrides":{"board":{"path":"/x","run":"../y"}}}}`;
  - `{"programs":{"overrides":{"board":{"path":"/x","color":"red"}}}}` (unknown key).

  A workspace `yolo-jail.jsonc` carrying `programs.overrides` is an error containing
  `user-scope only`. `ProgramOverrides` returns an empty map on a malformed user file: it fails
  closed, so no override applies. Red: `go test ./internal/config/ -run Overrides`.
- **Change:** `knownProgramsKeys` gains `overrides`; `validatePrograms` validates it;
  `ProgramOverrides(warn) map[string]ProgramOverride` reads the user file the way
  `ProgramsAutoprune` does.
- **Gates:** `go test ./internal/config/...`; `yolo check --no-build` against a scratch user config
  under `HOME=$(mktemp -d)`.
- **Fences:** `internal/config/programs*.go`, `config_ref.txt` only.
- **Ships with:** `config_ref.txt` `programs` paragraph (scope line: "USER SCOPE ONLY").
- **Commit:** `feat(config): declare per-program dev overrides at user scope`

### Task 3 — identity and projection (after 1)

- **Settled:** source `pack:<pack>/<from>`; revision is the tree digest of the staged
  `<root>/<from>` with `.git` skipped; recipe is `PackTreeRecipe(from, build, run)`, a sha256 over
  JSON tagged `"pack-tree"` plus a layout version `1`; produces are synthesized as
  `[".local/bin/<bin>", ".local/lib/yolo-programs/<bin>"]`.
- **Tests first:**
  - `PackTreeRecipe` differs from `ForkSourceRecipe` for equal strings, and changes when any of
    `build`, `run` or `from` changes;
  - `packload.PackTreePrograms` returns one `Fork` with `IsPackTree()` true, `Base == ""` and
    `Root` the pack root;
  - its digest helper ignores `.git/` and changes when one byte or one exec bit under `from`
    changes;
  - an absent `from` directory yields an empty digest and no error;
  - `InstallContributions` projects `Kind == "source"`, `IsPackTree()`, and the synthesized
    `Produces`, with `ProgramPath() == ".local/bin/board"`.

  Red: `go test ./internal/packdecl/ ./internal/packload/ -run PackTree`.
- **Change:** see the Map rows for Task 3, and the `InstallKindSource` audit (Traps).
- **Gates:** `go test ./internal/packdecl/... ./internal/packload/... ./internal/hostfloor/...
  ./internal/entrypoint/...`.
- **Commit:** `feat(packload): key a pack-tree program on its source directory's digest`
- **Report:** the 34-site audit table, one line per site: *excluded*, *shared* or *n/a*.

### Task 4 — the build, and the jail launch's pins (after 3)

- **Settled:**
  - the build is the fork route's act, sealed to the one pack;
  - its source is the staged pack's `from` minus `.git`;
  - the placement script copies the source into `~/.local/lib/yolo-programs/<bin>/`, runs `build`
    there, sets `+x` on `run`, and links `~/.local/bin/<bin>` → `../lib/yolo-programs/<bin>/<run>`;
  - the entry holds only those two paths, and anything else written is dropped and named in the
    log;
  - with no `build`, the host admits the same layout with no jail;
  - a hit prints nothing.
- **Tests first:**
  - unit (`internal/cli/forkbuild_test.go` seams): the placement script for
    `{bin: board, run: dist/board.js, build: "make"}` is exactly the string below. Pin it, then
    run it in a temp `HOME` with a fake `/workspace/src` through `bash -c` and assert the link
    resolves:

```text
d="$HOME/.local/lib/yolo-programs/board" && mkdir -p "$d" && cp -a /workspace/src/. "$d"/ && cd "$d" && { make ; } && test -f "$d/dist/board" && chmod +x "$d/dist/board" && mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin" && ln -sfn '../lib/yolo-programs/board/dist/board' "$HOME/.local/bin/board"
```

  - `admitPackTreeCopy` on a fixture tree yields an entry whose manifest lists exactly the two
    paths, and whose receipt carries `source: "pack:fx/tools/x"` and the digest;
  - integration (`integration/packtreeprogram_test.go`, `TestPackTreeProgramBuildsOnceAndRebuildsOnChange`):
    a `file://` pack with `tools/x/VERSION` = `1` and `run: "x"`, with this build line (JSON-escaped
    in the fixture):

```text
printf '#!/bin/sh\necho x-%s\n' "$(cat VERSION)" > x
```

    then:
    1. launch `yolo -- x`, and expect output `x-1` plus one build result line;
    2. write `2` into `VERSION` and launch again: `x-2` and one build line;
    3. launch again: `x-2` and no build line.

    This covers the design's done steps 1–3.
- **Change:** see the Map rows for Task 4.
- **Gates:** `go test ./internal/cli/... ./internal/capture/... ./internal/cli/run/...`; then
  `git add -N` the new files and run `go test -count=1 -run 'TestPackTree|TestForkBuild' ./integration`
  in the jail.
- **Fences:** no change to fork recipes or fork ids. Plain and patched fork entries must keep
  hitting.
- **Commit:** `feat(build): build a pack-tree program in the sealed build act`
- **Report:** the three integration runs' build lines, and the store key of each.

### Task 5 — failure, replacement and lines (after 4)

- **Settled:**
  - a failed build refuses that program, naming the log, `yolo pack build <pack>` and
    `YOLO_ALLOW_MISSING_PROGRAMS=1` ([OQ-BG1](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG1) leaning: the
    launch stops);
  - a waiter takes the winner's failure;
  - materializing a new key removes `~/.local/lib/yolo-programs/<bin>/` first.
- **Tests first:**
  - unit: the source launcher of a pack-tree program, given key B after key A, leaves no file of
    A's tree behind;
  - integration `TestPackTreeProgramBuildFailureRefusesOnlyIt`, using `withReadiness()`: a second
    program from an installer fixture beside a pack-tree program whose build is `exit 3`;
  - the launch exits `78` and its stderr names `.yolo/build-`, `yolo pack build fx` and
    `YOLO_ALLOW_MISSING_PROGRAMS`;
  - with the bypass, `yolo -- other` runs.

  This covers done step 6.
- **Gates:** `go test ./internal/entrypoint/... ./internal/cli/...`; the two integration tests.
- **Commit:** `feat(build): refuse an undeliverable pack-tree program, naming its log and retry`

### Task 6 — `yolo pack build` (after 4; parallel with 5)

- **Settled:** `yolo pack build [<pack>...] [--force] [--at jail|host]` on the host only.
  - No argument means every selected pack.
  - Each program prints one line: up to date, built (with digest and time), or failed (with its
    log).
  - A fork prints `yolo capture <bin>`, and an override is noted.
  - Exit 0, or 1 on any failure. In a jail it refuses with exit 2, naming the host command.
- **Tests first:** `internal/cli/packbuild_test.go`, against a fake build seam:
  - two calls build once and then report "up to date";
  - `--force` builds again;
  - an unknown pack exits 2, naming `yolo pack ls`;
  - `YOLO_IN_JAIL`-style detection (use the repo's `config.InJail` seam) refuses;
  - a fork prints `yolo capture`.
- **Gates:** `go test ./internal/cli/ -run PackBuild`; `yolo pack --help` lists `build`.
- **Ships with:** `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` `### Added`, one bold-lead paragraph covering the
  whole feature, linking the reference doc once it exists (or the design until then).
- **Commit:** `feat(pack): add yolo pack build`

### Task 7 — the prebuilt artifact (after 5)

- **Settled:**
  - used when `from` is absent, or (by [OQ-BG2](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG2)'s leaning) when
    the builder is permanently unavailable;
  - fetched through `packbin` by the launch slot, `yolo pack install`/`update` and
    `yolo pack build`;
  - admitted on the host as `~/.local/lib/yolo-programs/<bin>/<bin>` plus the link;
  - disclosed on every fresh launch and attach with its sha256;
  - never after a failed build.
- **Tests first:**
  - unit: a digest mismatch caches nothing, and its message names both digests;
  - a present `from` never fetches (assert zero requests to the TLS test server);
  - integration `TestPackTreeProgramUsesThePrebuiltWithoutSources`: the step-1 fixture with
    `tools/x` deleted and a `prebuilt` served by the local TLS fixture; `yolo -- x` runs it, and
    the launch prints a line containing the first 12 hex digits of its sha256 (done step 5).
- **Commit:** `feat(build): fall back to a pack's verified prebuilt artifact when it has no source`

### Task 8 — the dev override on container backends (after 2 and 5)

- **Settled:**
  - an override wins over every rung, for any program, keyed by `bin`;
  - `path` inside the workspace runs from `/workspace/<rel>`; otherwise from a read-only
    `/ctx/program-overrides/<bin>`;
  - a path at the credential boundary is refused;
  - the launcher execs `<dir>/<run>` and never builds or falls through
    ([OQ-BG3](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG3) leaning);
  - install-only checks that the file exists, and a missing one refuses the launch
    ([OQ-BG1](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG1) leaning), naming the build line;
  - disclosed on every fresh launch and attach.
- **Tests first:**
  - unit: the override launcher's text for `{dir:/ctx/program-overrides/board, run:dist/board.js}`
    execs exactly that path with `"$@"`;
  - an override for an npm program without `run` refuses it, naming `programs.overrides.<bin>.run`;
  - `path: "$HOME"` is refused through `WorkspaceScopeBreach`;
  - a symlinked path is resolved before the check;
  - integration `TestPackTreeProgramOverrideRunsTheCheckout`: user config
    `programs.overrides.x.path` = `<workspace>/dev/x`, with `run` = `x`, a script printing
    `dev-1`; the launch prints the override line and `yolo -- x` prints `dev-1`;
  - rewrite the script to print `dev-2` and run `yolo -- x` again on the same jail via attach:
    `dev-2` with no fresh launch (done step 4).
- **Fences:** `internal/macosuser` (Task 10), `internal/hostfloor` (Task 9).
- **Commit:** `feat(launch): run a program from a user-scope dev override`

### Task 9 — `yolo host` on Linux (after 5 and 8)

- **Settled:** the floor builds a pack-tree program through the same act, resolved by digest with
  no pin, and materializes it relocated as for a fork (FP-D16). An override writes
  `<floor>/bin/<bin>` to exec the host path.
- **Tests first:** `internal/hostfloor/built_test.go` gains a pack-tree program that needs no pin
  and resolves by digest; `internal/cli/hostfloorfork_test.go` gains an override arm.
- **Gates:** `go test ./internal/hostfloor/... ./internal/cli/ -run HostFloor`; on a Linux host
  (not nested), done steps 1–6 with `yolo host -- x`.
- **Commit:** `feat(host): deliver pack-tree programs and dev overrides on the host floor`

### Task 10 — macos-user and a Mac's `yolo host` (after 9; **needs a real Mac**)

- **Settled:**
  - the darwin sealed act builds a pack-tree program (FP-D24's path);
  - the prebuilt takes its darwin entry, and with no sandbox account it stands in
    ([OQ-BG2](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG2) leaning);
  - an override is a `ContextLink` that the profile grants read and exec under.
- **Tests first:** on Linux, the rendered profile for a launch with one override contains the read
  and exec rules under the resolved path, in both profiles; extend
  `TestEverySeatbeltDenyCarriesATestID` if a rule id is added. On a Mac,
  `integration/macosuserprograms_test.go` gains the six done steps under `macos-user`.
- **Gates:** Linux unit tests. The native evidence is a Mac run of `-run '^TestMacosUser.*PackTree'`,
  or a `macos-user.yml` dispatch, recorded with host and date.
- **Commit:** `feat(macosuser): deliver pack-tree programs and dev overrides in the sandbox`

Apple Container needs no task of its own: Tasks 4–8 run there unchanged. Its verification is a
real-Mac run of the integration tests under `YOLO_RUNTIME=container`, which is owed with Task 10.

## Ships with

- **Unit tests:** as listed per task. The degenerate cases the design enumerates:
  - `from: "."`;
  - an empty `from` directory, which fails with "produced no `<run>`";
  - `run` naming a directory;
  - an empty `prebuilt`;
  - a platform `prebuilt` lacks;
  - an override for an undeclared `bin`, reported by `yolo check` as information.
- **Integration:** `integration/packtreeprogram_test.go` covers done steps 1–6. It is the test
  that catches a regression end to end; the unit tests do not.
- **Tests that must change, and be rewritten to the new behavior:** `TestKnownViasCoversTheShippedMechanisms`'s
  `viaList()` literal, and any `KnownVias()` golden.
- **Docs:**
  - `docs/reference/pack-system.md` (program schema);
  - `docs/reference/program-readiness.md` (a pack-tree program joins the act, so add one line);
  - `docs/reference/pack-binaries.md` *What this does not license* (point the build-step bullet
    at this route);
  - `internal/cli/config_ref.txt` (`programs.overrides`);
  - `yolo pack --help`;
  - `CHANGELOG.md`.

  When the design is built, it graduates into a `docs/reference/pack-tree-programs.md` system doc
  in the same commit that deletes this plan.
- **Error text** is the implementer's to word. The facts each refusal carries are fixed in the
  design's [precedence table](pack-buildable-programs.md#4-precedence-one-resolver-four-rungs).
- **Cheap, and the implementer's choice:** map types; whether `PackTreePrograms` lives in a new
  file; the override env var's JSON field names.
- **Stop and ask:** anything that would change a fork's recipe or id, so that existing store
  entries stop hitting, or that would let a launch build inside a jail.

## Don't

- Don't add an `Install.Kind "pack"`. The source launcher, materialize and readiness are already
  correct for `"source"`, and a new kind means teaching all 34 sites instead of excluding the
  handful that read a pin.
- Don't digest the original pack directory. Digest the launch's staged copy, which nothing edits.
- Don't fetch a prebuilt while a build is possible ([P5](pack-buildable-programs.md#P5)).
- Don't add a stat cache for the digest before a measurement asks for one.
- Don't build an override ([OQ-BG3](pack-buildable-programs.md#OQ-BG3)).
