# Native capture compatibility context

**Status:** 2026-10-29. Capture-context repair is built in the reviewed candidate and assembled for the combined gate. **UNMEASURED:** native Mac capture/Seatbelt behavior and the separate self-mode version-parse report remain unverified; the original emitter/output witness is still owed.

Written against `8c0bc42f3a72e19b9f27a06f33b1fdf4a63c4679`.
Behavior authority: [program delivery](program-delivery.md); scope and constraints are the accepted
Astra tactical wave. Design wins on behavior, tree wins on fact, plan is perishable advice.

## Settled boundary

A native capture's generated program launcher must receive its resolved self/account mode, not
missing metadata or composed user metadata. Reuse the launch's existing protected JSON carrier;
no schema, compatibility bypass, version threshold, SecurityServer grant, or broker change.
Capture roots are its own staging root and staging home; account mode has no owner temp roots.
Self mode carries only its resolved user-temp/shared-temp grants already present in its profile.
Unknown capture modes must remain invalid: do not let `captureRunAs`'s account fallback mint valid
account context for an invalid requested mode.

The capture producer calls the shared bootstrap builder, which marks a native workspace,
but does not compose the JSON context that the compatibility guard requires. The joined regression
below reproduced RED on baseline through a read-only Go overlay: all three cases emitted
`invalid macos-user launch context` (package runtime 0.016s, exit 1). The writer must retain that
same test permanently and confirm RED before production edits. This does not establish the
cause of the old native self-mode parse report, whose raw version output remains missing.

## Map and reuse

| Path | Bounded change |
| :--- | :--- |
| `internal/macosuser/capture.go` | `buildCapturePlanAt`: replace composed context with capture-owned context before bootstrap/driver env composition |
| `internal/macosuser/capturecompatibility_test.go` | New permanent joined capture-plan → bootstrap variables → real launcher generator → install-only guard regression |
| `scripts/completion-readers.json` | Generated census output for the new external-package/file-reading test |

Reuse `MarshalSandboxTmpdirValidationContext`, `withoutEnvVar`, `withEnvVar`,
`argvEnvValue`, `sandboxEnvFileValue`, and the existing launch producer in
`internal/macosuser/runplan.go` as the carrier/equality shape, without editing that file.
The owning-pack decoder and strict 4096-byte legacy files loader remain unchanged.

## Task — independent capture producer repair

**Preconditions:** baseline ancestry present, writer tree clean; no other writer owns the capture
producer hunk. Stop and report if RED differs, source is dirty, symbols disappear, a file outside
this fence is needed, or a gate fails outside scope. Do not reset, stash, amend, or clean caches.

**Tests first:** write the complete permanent regression below; run only that test, preserve RED
output, and hold with the lead before any production edit. Fixture setup choices are cheap; exact
behavior, fake version-only invocation, and production callers are not choices.

Imports required by this file: standard `io`, `os`, `os/exec`, `path/filepath`, `strings`, `testing`;
project `entrypoint`, `packload`, `paths`. Resolve fixture-minted temp paths with `EvalSymlinks` where
path equality requires it, preserving Darwin reproducibility.

**Change:** compose and overwrite protected context from capture's resolved roots/mode before calling
`buildBootstrapEnv`; explicitly relay its final value into bootstrap (same contract as run plan).
Preserve the driver environment's identical value and original caller `SandboxEnv` immutability.
If marshaling fails, retain fail-closed behavior rather than substituting account or a bypass.

**Gates:** permanent RED command `go test -short ./internal/macosuser -run '^TestCapturePlanCompatibilityOwnsItsResolvedContext$' -count=1 -v`;
then GREEN same command, affected capture/context tests, owning-pack/version-only entrypoint controls,
`just format`, and `python3 scripts/completion-census.py` for external fixture reads. A nested smoke
may verify container non-regression only; it cannot establish native Mac capture behavior.
Root owns combined landing/full integration gate; no per-lane full suite.

**Fences:** capture producer and new regression file only (enforced by lead diff review). Read-only
runplan, entrypoint/shims, host launch/auth, A inherited scope and D view lifecycle; no overlap edits.
Real installed agent CLIs may be invoked only with `--version`. Deterministic repository-owned fake
executables may exercise dispatch only when explicit executable/PATH confinement prevents fallthrough
to real agents or network/API/login/credential use. No real credentials/keychains.

**Commit:** `fix(macosuser): carry resolved compatibility context into captures`.
**Report:** exact RED and GREEN receipts, paths, diffstat, final SHA, unresolved native parse witness.
No Main landing/push/install/deploy/release. Leave the manual writer tree locked for Root.
