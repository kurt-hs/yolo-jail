// green/red) or strip it (piped output / color off).

// that tests for presence rather than value as a request for no color.

// non-empty — the jail was launched with NO_COLOR — and every exec would inherit it, so
// the entrypoint, the prompt and the agents would stay colorless while the host half of
// this same attach colors. That pair is `-e NO_COLOR=`: EMPTY, which the convention
// counts as unset, because `podman exec` cannot remove a variable outright.
