// yolostepfatal_test.go drives PD-NF1 (the maintainer's ruling of 2026-10-16,
// docs/design/program-delivery.md) through the advance's real call sites: when yolo has found a newer
// candidate of a patched fork or extension and ONE OF YOLO'S OWN BUILD STEPS keeps it from building —
// the runtime not starting a build jail, a lock wait that runs out, an error replaying the series —
// the act STOPS with the one refusal shape, as for a failed build (OQ-PPX3), and never runs the older
// build on its own. Only a hatch the user set or an `agent_updates` hold runs it. Being unable to
// reach upstream at all is no failure: what is here runs, and the act says it could not check.
