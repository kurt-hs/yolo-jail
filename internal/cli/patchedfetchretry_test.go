// patchedfetchretry_test.go pins what a FAILED FETCH leaves behind for the next launch
// (patchedadvance.go, packsrc/patchcheck.go; docs/design/patched-forks.md §4.2, §8.1): a check that
// could not reach the upstream — the machine's network not up yet at boot — is a transient fault,
// never the upstream's answer. A later fresh launch with nothing built to run fetches again itself,
// inside the hour the earlier attempt's stamp would otherwise hold, and builds; and the refusal the
// earlier launch printed names the network and the next step. Reported 2026-10-16: a launch at
// boot, before the network was up, failed its fetch, and every launch for the next hour refused
// with "the next fresh launch tries again" without fetching, until `yolo pack update`.
