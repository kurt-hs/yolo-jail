package entrypoint

// forklauncher.go is the jail's half of a FORK's delivery (docs/design/forked-programs-as-packs.md
// FP-D8, the plan's step 6): the SOURCE LAUNCHER, generated for a program a fork builds, which
// materializes the store entry the host decided on and execs it.
//
// # The host decides, the jail materializes
//
// Which entry answers a fork is a question about the fork LOCK — the pinned commit — and the lock
// lives in the user config directory, which no jail can read. So the host answers it (run's
// forkDeliveriesFor, after building on a miss) and hands the jail, per bin, the store KEY to
// materialize or the REASON there is none, in one env pair (ForkBuildsEnv), read once at boot and
// baked into the launcher as every other launcher fact is.
//
// # What the launcher never does
//
//   - Fall back to the base's delivery. The installer route's download fallback is not this
//     route's: a fork whose build failed is one missing tool (§9), and running the base's upstream
//     program under the fork's name would be the wrong program looking like the right one.
//   - Run a build it was not handed. A key is the host's answer for THIS launch; a home that still
//     holds an older build of the fork is re-materialized from the new key, and with no key the
//     launcher refuses rather than running the stale revision (§9: never serve a near-miss).
//   - Update itself. A fork moves when its pin does (`yolo pack update` on the host); in update
//     mode the launcher says so and changes nothing.
