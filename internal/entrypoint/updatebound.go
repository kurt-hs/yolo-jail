// updatebound.go is the launchers' UPDATE BOUND: how every UPDATE ACT — a pack's declared update
// verb and its pre-launch refresh — is run, in all three launcher templates (npm, native and the
// fork's source launcher), so that one cannot hang the command the user typed nor take the
// user's terminal (docs/design/program-delivery.md §3.5, OQ-PD22). "Update act" and "update
// bound" are terms coined here for those two things; §3.5 states the bound's properties.
//
// # The hang it replaced
//
// Measured 2026-10-01: `claude` sat on "Updating claude..." for over five minutes, and a Ctrl-C
// did nothing. The update ran under GNU timeout(1), which runs its command in a process group of
// its own on the user's terminal. `claude install` switches that terminal to raw mode at once,
// which the kernel answers, for a process outside the terminal's foreground group, by stopping it
// with SIGTTOU: about 20 ms in, before it did any work. At 60 s timeout sent SIGTERM; claude's
// handler restores the terminal, so it was usually stopped again inside the handler, and timeout,
// given no -k, then had nothing left to send and waited on a process nothing would continue. A
// Ctrl-C went to the terminal's foreground group, the launcher's, and so reached nothing that
// could act on it.
//
// # What replaced it
//
// The act runs through `yolo internal no-terminal` with its bound (internal/notty): no controlling
// terminal and a /dev/null stdin, so no terminal call can stop it (PS-D1's detach, which the
// vendor installers already had); SIGTERM at UPDATE_TIMEOUT and SIGKILL UPDATE_GRACE later; and
// the terminal's Ctrl-C forwarded to it, with the same grace. GNU timeout -k is only the fallback
// for a launcher no yolo with that verb can serve, and it then runs in the terminal's own process
// group (--foreground), which keeps both the Ctrl-C and the terminal working.
//
// A Ctrl-C ends the ACT, not the launcher (_shielded): the user typed the program's name, and the
// installed version is there to run. That is the opposite of a Ctrl-C at a COLD install, which
// still ends the launcher (PS-D7), because there is nothing to run.

// updateBoundShellFn is spliced into all three templates once, ahead of every caller. It reads the
// template's own BIN and UPDATE_TIMEOUT. UPDATE_GRACE is spelled here, once, rather than in each
// template's header beside UPDATE_TIMEOUT, because nothing but this fragment reads it.

# SIGINT) means the interrupt ended it: the probe runs "true", and a yolo without the verb exits 2.
# The launcher cannot wait for its own SIGINT instead. macOS signals a process group's members one
# at a time, newest first (XNU's pgrp_iterate), so the launcher, the group's oldest member, is
# signaled last, and on a busy machine the probe has died of its SIGINT and been reaped by then.
# bash then runs the trap after the check that follows the probe, or never: bash 3.2, macOS's
# /bin/bash, drops a SIGINT landing as it finishes waiting for a child it has reaped. Seen on
# check-macos on 2026-10-06: the update then ran unbounded, after the Ctrl-C. So the probe's
# status counts as the Ctrl-C, and the launcher sends itself the SIGINT, doing what the Ctrl-C
# would have made it do there: under _shielded the trap sets _YOLO_INTERRUPTED before the next
