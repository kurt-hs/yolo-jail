// Package patchrecovery is the one vocabulary of a PATCHED BUILD'S RECOVERY HATCHES
// (docs/reference/patched-forks.md, "Recovery hatches"): the environment variables a user puts in
// front of one command to get past a patched fork or patched extension that will not build, the
// grammar of their values, and the one shape every refusal lists them in.
//
// A hatch is for broken EXTERNAL state, never for a yolo bug: an upstream that moved incompatibly
// or broke its own build. Every hatch is opt-in, read by the act it is typed in front of, and
// never persisted or forwarded into a jail.
//
// THE VALUE GRAMMAR (Parse), shared by every hatch here: "1" covers every patched build the act
// selects; otherwise a comma-separated list of names, each matching a patched build by its key
// (`pi-fork/pi`), its pack (`pi-fork`) or its bin or extension name (`pi`). An empty value is unset.
//
// THE OUTPUT SHAPE (Section), ruled 2026-10-16: a blank line, a heading, then one copyable command
// per line with a few words of label. No justification prose.
