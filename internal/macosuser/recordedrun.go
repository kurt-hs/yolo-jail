// recordedrun.go keeps a child's own output where the act's reader can find it: Deps.RunRecorded,
// and the capture bootstrap's use of it (runCaptureSteps).
//
// WHY THE BOOTSTRAP NEEDS IT. Every other crossing inherits this process's stdout and stderr
// (runReal says why). A build jail's log keeps what the act writes to Out, not what a child
// writes to the inherited descriptors, so a capture bootstrap that failed on a Mac left one line
// in the build log, "the staging home has no generated launcher", and nothing of the bootstrap's
// own reason (docs/lab-reports/2026-10-23-native-mac-verification.md §2). The bootstrap is
// non-interactive (its crossing is `sudo -n`, or `/usr/bin/env` as you), so a pipe changes no
// prompt; its output is copied to Out, bounded, and its refusal carries its exit status and the
// tail of its stderr.
