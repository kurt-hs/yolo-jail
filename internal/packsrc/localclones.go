// localclones.go is the LOCAL CLONE MAP (a term coined here; docs/reference/patched-forks.md §3.5, PF-D100):
// the git clones on this machine the user's config reaches, each keyed by the URLs of its remotes, so a patch
// branch a pack names by its PUBLISHED URL is resolved against the user's own clone of that repository with
// the newest-copy-wins rule of a local checkout (patchbranchcopy.go, PF-D99).
//
// The maintainer's rulings (2026-10-24): a pack file always names published URLs; "if you have a path into
// any local clone of a repository, that adds that repository to the mapping, and because of the newest wins,
// this is safe even for other packs"; and "we can just also have a user level config to register them
// regardless" — `local_clones`.
//
//   - WHO REGISTERS. config (localclones.go there) gathers the map from the USER config: every path a pack is
//     read from that lands inside a git clone (a pack named by path or by git+file://, the conventional local
//     pack), and every `local_clones` entry. A plain-files pack in no repository registers nothing. A broken
//     `local_clones` value is the source's error, and the check refuses with it.
//   - WHEN IT APPLIES. A patch branch whose repository is a URL (not a directory on this machine) that names
//     the same repository as a remote of a registered clone is resolved as that clone's local checkout, with
//     ONLY THAT REMOTE compared against (PF-D104). The record still keys the resolution by the locator as
//     written, so a reader with no map (a jail) reads the same record.
//   - ONLY A REF THE URL HAS (PF-D104). Newest-wins is safe only for a branch the published repository has, so
//     a clone answers only for a branch name (never a refs/... spelling, a tag or a commit) that the clone holds
//     as that remote's tracking ref, refs/remotes/<remote>/<ref>, from a remote whose fetch address (its first url,
//     after insteadOf) names that repository. The clone then answers as any checkout does: ahead, diverged (loud)
//     or after a failed fetch (loud) its local branch builds. Anything else — a local-only branch, another remote's branch —
//     is built from the URL as if no clone existed, and the line names the clone and why it was not used.
//   - WHICH CLONE. An explicit `local_clones` entry before an implicit one, then config order (the order the
//     source returns them in). The provenance line names the clone it used and why.
//   - ONCE PER CHECK. CheckPatched asks the source once, and only for a patch branch at a URL (chooseClone).
//   - READ ONLY. Gathering runs `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and reads the clone's remote URLs from its
//     configuration; choosing reads the tracking ref; nothing is ever written to the clone.
