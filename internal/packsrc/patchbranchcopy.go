package packsrc

// patchbranchcopy.go is a PATCH BRANCH GIVEN AS A LOCAL CHECKOUT — a relative locator or a git+file:// one
// naming a repository on this machine (docs/reference/patched-forks.md §3.5, PF-D99). Its rule, the
// maintainer's (2026-10-24): BUILD FROM WHICHEVER COPY OF THE BRANCH IS NEWEST, AND ALWAYS SAY WHICH COPY AND
// HOW IT RELATES TO THE OTHER.
//
//   - TWO COPIES. The checkout's local branch (refs/heads/<ref>, read through the patch branch's own mirror,
//     which is fetched from the checkout as before) and its remote's tip, which yolo fetches from the
//     checkout's remote (origin, else the first by name) INTO A MIRROR OF ITS OWN, by the same per-mirror
//     fetch a patch branch at a URL takes (non-interactive: GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0, no askpass, the user's
//     ssh command left alone, so ssh may still prompt at a terminal in `yolo pack install`/`update`) in a
//     BUDGET OF ITS OWN, half of what the check has left (budget.share), so a hung fetch times out as a failed
//     fetch and the steps after it keep theirs. Nothing is ever fetched into, or written to, the user's
//     repository.
//   - WHEN. At every check, and at every fresh launch inside the hourly throttle as well
//     (CheckOptions.RefreshPatchBranch): a branch that moved is a new build key and the normal check and
//     build run. At most once per repository and ref per command (patchBranchFetches).
//   - WHICH COPY. No local branch: the remote tip. Equal: either. The local branch behind: the remote tip,
//     and the local branch is said to be stale. Ahead: the local branch, with its unpushed commits counted.
//     Diverged: the local branch, warned loudly with both commits and counts and the push that repairs a
//     rebase. A fetch that failed never refuses: the local branch, else the newer (by ancestry; diverged, the
//     tracking ref) of the remote tip yolo last fetched and the checkout's own refs/remotes/<remote>/<ref>,
//     so the `git fetch` the line suggests is what builds next, else the plain order (resolvePatchBranchRef),
//     said "not verified" with the last good fetch's age and the fetch to run by hand. A fetch that succeeded
//     and shows the remote no longer has the branch (RemoteGone): the local branch, "not on <remote>"; with
//     none, the checkout's stale tracking ref, said to be one, loudly, with the push that restores it.
//   - ONE LINE (PatchBranchResolved.Line) from the check record, so the launch, `yolo pack update`, `yolo
//     pack series check` and `yolo pack status` cannot disagree about which copy they judged.
