// rebaserecipe.go is the REBASE RECIPE (a term coined here): the git commands, with the commits
// filled in, that rebase a patch series onto an upstream commit it no longer fits, for the user or
// their agent to run (docs/reference/patched-forks.md §8.4, PF-D85, which retired `yolo pack
// rebase`). Every line that names the repair of a series prints it through RebaseRecipe.Repair:
// the error block (PatchFailure.Block), `yolo pack update` and `yolo pack status`, `yolo pack
// series check`, cached-good recovery and the base lag's re-anchoring. yolo never runs it and
// never writes the series.
//
// The steps: clone the upstream; on a branch at the series' base apply the series with `git am`
// and tag the applied tip; `git rebase <target>`, which drops a member upstream already holds by
// patch-id as the launch's replay does (PF-D86) — `--onto <target> <base>` would not, comparing
// against nothing between the two; resolve each stop; then the EXPORT, one command line whose
// every step runs only once the one before it succeeded, kept from PF-D49:
//
//   - a test that the rebase branch holds a commit neither the target nor the applied tip reaches,
//     so pasted mid-rebase (the branch is still the applied tip), after an abort, or after a rebase
//     that dropped every member, it changes nothing;
//   - `mkdir <patches>.new`, which refuses an earlier export's leftover;
//   - `git format-patch --src-prefix=a/ --dst-prefix=b/ --no-signature --suffix=.patch
//     --base=<target>` into it, reading the BRANCH, never HEAD, with `.patch` names and a/ b/
//     prefixes whatever the user's config says, since the series reads only `.patch` files and
//     `git am` strips one path component. The prefixes are flags, never `-c format.noprefix=false`:
//     git 2.50 (Apple Git 2.50.1 among them) reads ANY value of format.noprefix as true, so that
//     setting exported a series with no prefixes at all, which `git am` refuses;
//   - the two renames and the `rm`, so a launch never reads an empty or partial series.
