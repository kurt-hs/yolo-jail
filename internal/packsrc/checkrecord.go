// checkrecord.go is a patched fork's CHECK RECORD and its lock (docs/reference/patched-forks.md §6.2,
// PF-D9, PF-D22): one record per OWNER KEY in the pack store — the check stamp and what the last
// check read, the last check's commit and the walk's list with its sequence number, the good
// build, and one outcome per entry of the list.
//
// THE OWNER KEY (a term coined in the design, PF-D22) is `<pack>/<bin>` for a patched fork and
// `<pack>/<name>` for a patched extension (pi-extensions.md), so one record and one lock
// serve both routes; nothing here knows which it is keyed for.
//
// MACHINE-LOCAL BY DESIGN: the record never leaves this machine and nothing writes it to the fork
// lock (§6.5). It is written only under its own flock, through a temp file and a rename, and read
// without the lock, so a reader sees one whole record or the previous one.
//
// Layout, beside the store's other per-repository state (store.go):
//
//	<PacksDir>/checks/<owner-slug>.json        the record
//	<PacksDir>/locks/check-<owner-slug>.lock   its flock
//
// LOCK ORDER (§6.6, PF-D17): the build's own lock, then this record lock, then a mirror lock;
// nothing waits for an earlier lock while it holds a later one. This file takes only the record
// lock; CheckPatched takes the mirror lock inside it.
