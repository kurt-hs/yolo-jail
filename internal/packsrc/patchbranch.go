// patchbranch.go is a PATCH BRANCH (docs/reference/patched-forks.md §3.5, OQ-PFK6): a commit graph a patched fork
// or extension names in place of a `patches` series — a repository and a branch whose ancestry
// includes the upstream's — merged against each upstream candidate by `git merge-tree
// --write-tree` instead of replayed.
//
// ONE MACHINERY WITH THE SERIES (PF-D89). A patch branch is a Series whose members are not files but one
// commit, so the check, its record and throttle, the walk, the ratchet, the store key and every
// explicit act read it through the same types:
//
//   - THE CHECK FETCHES IT. Whenever a check runs (its own throttle, an explicit act, or a retry of
//     a failed fetch with nothing to run, PF-D88), after the upstream's fetch step and in the same
//     budget, the patch branch's repository is fetched INTO ITS OWN MIRROR by the per-mirror fetch step a
//     pack's repository takes (blobless, fsck'd, its tags put back), under both mirrors' locks taken
//     in one order (lockMirrors). A blobless mirror cannot take another repository's objects: a
//     fetch from a remote that is not its promisor, under transfer.fsckObjects, refuses every tree
//     naming a blob it lacks (MEASURED, git 2.55: "did not receive expected object"). The replay's
//     scratch repository borrows both mirrors' objects instead (newScratchOf). A fetch that fails is
//     the check's failed fetch, classified by TransportFailure, and the copy the patch branch's mirror
//     already holds keeps answering, as an upstream's does.
//   - THE CHECK RESOLVES IT: the branch to a commit, and the commit's MERGE BASE with the upstream
//     ref's tip, which is the patch branch's base — the newest upstream commit it already contains. The
//     walk's list holds only versions containing it, and the first advance falls back to it, where
//     the merge is the patch branch's own tree. A patch branch that shares no history with the upstream names no
//     base: the check's problem, never a conflict.
//   - THE RECORD KEEPS IT (CheckRecord.Patch branch), apart from the last check's findings, so a later
//     check with a problem does not lose what the good build is keyed by; every reader rebuilds
//     the series from it with no git (PatchBranchSeries), so a launch inside the hour runs no git (P4).
//   - THE DIGEST is PatchBranchDigest(commit), which takes the series digest's place in the recipe: a
//     build is keyed on the upstream commit and the patch branch's commit, so a moved branch is a new
//     build and two machines that resolve one commit build the same bytes.
